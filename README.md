Use average value to replace any missing value or inconsistent data within the variables.
Complete your analysis for the first 5 questions using Pivot Tables in Excel based on the provided dataset.
For each analytical question, create a separate Pivot Table and include a brief summary of your findings.
Complete your analysis for the last 2 questions using Data Analysis ToolPak in Excel based on the provided dataset. Significance level = 0.05. No need to test any assumptions.
For each research question, create a separate worksheet and include a brief summary of your findings.
